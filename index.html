    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Ankan Chatterjee, a 19-year-old B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). From my early days immersed in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Science during my school years, I discovered my fascination with technology and its potential to solve real-world challenges.</p>
    <p>As a dedicated CSE student, I enjoy exploring the realms of programming, algorithms, and emerging technologies. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong grasp of software development, data structures, and artificial intelligence—subjects that truly ignite my curiosity and drive.</p>
    <p>Outside the classroom, I thrive on creativity and hands-on experiences. Whether it’s crafting small-scale projects, experimenting with new programming languages, or brainstorming innovative ideas, I’m always eager to turn knowledge into action.</p>
    <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me staying up-to-date with tech innovations, exploring how technology can impact the world positively, or simply unwinding with a good book, music, or a refreshing walk in nature.</p>
    <p>I aspire to become a tech innovator, working at the intersection of web development, app development, and sustainable technologies to create solutions that make a difference. With an insatiable appetite for learning and a passion for innovation, I’m ready to shape the future—one line of code at a time.</p>
